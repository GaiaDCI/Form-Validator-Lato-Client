Validation form to register.
Two pages and a JavaScript file that allows you to register by entering a valid email address like 
*example@gmail.com* 
and a password  (with letters and numbers) long eight characters like
*hello173* 

If the data entered is valid, continue on the next page, 
otherwise, we receive two errors in the input form (like in the screenshots).
